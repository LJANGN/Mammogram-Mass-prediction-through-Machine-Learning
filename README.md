# Mammogram-Mass-prediction-through-Machine-Learning
A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. If we can build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning, it could improve a lot of lives.The aim is to apply several different supervised machine learning techniques, and see which one yields the highest accuracy.
